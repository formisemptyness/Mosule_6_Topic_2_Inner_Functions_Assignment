# Mosule_6_Topic_2_Inner_Functions_Assignment
Create a python file inner_functions_assignment.py. In your inner_functions_assignment.py, write a function measurements that accepts a list of measurements for a rectangle and returns a string with perimeter and area      Write 2 inner functions that accept a list as parameter         area(a_list) -- calculates the area             recall accessing items in a list: a_list[#]         perimeter(a_list) -- calculates the perimeter             recall accessing items in a list: a_list[#]     The outer, measurements function will call the area() and the perimeter()     The outer function will build a string and return the following string:         Perimeter = 11.0 Area = 7.14  # if this is the perimeter and the area.      Next, add necessary statements to calculate for a square the perimeter and the area.         len(a_list) is helpful to decide if the list has 1 or 2 items.     In your main, call the function for a square and for a rectangle
